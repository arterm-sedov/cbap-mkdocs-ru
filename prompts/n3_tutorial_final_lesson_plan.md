## Business Context: HR Candidate Selection System

**Data Model:**
- **Candidates** → Personal info, skills, experience
- **Positions** → Requirements, department, manager
- **Skills** → Technical competencies, levels
- **Interviews** → Process, results, feedback
- **Offers** → Terms, approval workflow, status

**Progressive Complexity:**
1. **Basic queries** → Get candidate department
2. **Navigation** → Candidate → Manager → Department
3. **Filtering** → Role-based access, conditional logic
4. **Aggregation** → Skills analysis, experience calculations
5. **Integration** → Complete candidate management workflow

**Business Value:**
- End-to-end candidate lifecycle management
- Role-based access control
- Performance optimization
- Complex data relationships
- Real-world applicability

## Assessment Strategy

**Structure:**
- **2-3 questions per lesson** (total: 10-15 questions)
- **Answers provided at bottom** of tests.md
- **Mix of theoretical and practical**
- **Progressive difficulty** matching lesson complexity

**Question Types:**
- **Concept understanding** (triple structure, syntax)
- **Practical application** (write N3 queries)
- **Problem solving** (debug existing queries)
- **Integration** (combine multiple concepts)

## Comprehensive Analysis Results

### **1. Coverage Analysis: `@n3_tutorial.md`**

**✅ COMPLETE COVERAGE ACHIEVED**
- **Five types of queries** → Lesson 1 (foundation)
- **Query processing order & interpreter behavior** → Lesson 1 (theory)
- **Iterator mechanics** → Lesson 2 (collections)
- **Variable assignment patterns** → Lesson 2 (navigation)
- **Built-in functions** (all libraries) → Lesson 4 (functions)
- **Control flow** (conditional logic) → Lesson 3 (logic)
- **Assert functions** (all types) → Lesson 4-5 (advanced)

**No critical concepts lost** - all theoretical foundations preserved and properly sequenced.

### **2. Coverage Analysis: `@sources/`**

**✅ LEAN & DRY IMPLEMENTATION**
- **Video transcripts** → Condensed into practical exercises
- **Presentation content** → Integrated into core lessons
- **NotebookLM notes** → Streamlined into focused examples
- **Multiple summaries** → Consolidated into single coherent narrative

**Result:** Sources distilled to essential patterns without information overload, maintaining technical accuracy while eliminating redundancy.

### **3. Business Case Analysis**

**✅ END-TO-END & PRACTICAL VALUE**

**HR Candidate Selection System:**
- **Data model**: Complete candidate lifecycle management
- **Progressive complexity**: Simple queries → Complex filtering → Aggregations → Integration
- **Real-world scenarios**: Role-based access, performance optimization, data relationships
- **Business outcomes**: Working candidate management system with practical applicability

**Business value:** Complete workflow from candidate entry to offer management, addressing real HR department needs.

### **4. Prompt Compliance Analysis**

**✅ FLEXIBLE ADHERENCE ACHIEVED**
- **Learning outcomes prioritized** over strict structure
- **N3 basics coverage comprehensive** but not overwhelming
- **Pedagogical approach flexible** while maintaining standards
- **Integration points optional** (HR context available but not required)

**Balance achieved:** Structure provides guidance without constraining creativity or adaptability.

### **5. Diátaxis Tutorial Approach Analysis**

**✅ LOOSELY FOLLOWED WITH BEST PRACTICES INTEGRATION**

**Applied principles:**
- **Learning-oriented** → Focus on skill acquisition
- **Concrete actions** → Hands-on exercises in every lesson
- **Minimal explanation** → Theory integrated into practice
- **Confidence building** → Progressive success milestones
- **Visible results** → Each lesson produces working N3 queries

**Computer science best practices prevail:**
- **Progressive complexity** → Logical skill building
- **Performance awareness** → Optimization from start
- **Practical application** → Real-world problem solving
- **Error handling** → Common pitfalls addressed

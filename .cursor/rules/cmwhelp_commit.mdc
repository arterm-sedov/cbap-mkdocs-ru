This rule applies to commit messages.

# Commit Message Rule

**Important requirement:**
- The commit message must always start with the ticket/issue number, which is taken from the current branch name.
- Format:
  `[#XXXXX] Concise description of the change`
  where `XXXXX` is the number at the start of the branch name (up to the first `_` or other separator).

**Algorithm:**
1. Find a previous commit message, it might already contain the [#XXXXX] pattern.
2. Determine the current branch name.
3. Extract the first sequence of digits (usually up to the `_` character).
4. Use it in square brackets with a `#` at the start of the commit message (no spaces inside the brackets).
5. After the brackets, provide a concise, to-the-point description of the change.

**Correct examples:**
- `[#12345] Add new documentation section`
- `[#67890] Fix data processing bug`

**Incorrect examples:**
- `Add new documentation section`
- `[12345] Fix bug`
- `[ #12345 ] Fix bug in module X, add tests, update docs` (spaces inside brackets)
- `[#12345] Fix bug in module X, add tests, update docs` (too long)

**Requirements:**
- The message must be concise, structured, and strictly relevant to the change.
- Keep the length to the minimum necessary.

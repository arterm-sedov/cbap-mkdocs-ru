This rule applies to commit messages.

# Commit Message Rule

**Important requirement:**

- Always start the commit message with the ticket/issue number.
- Take the issue number from the current branch name (eg., `12345_branch_name`) or from the previous commit message if the branch name does not have the issue number.
- Format:
  `[#XXXXX] Concise description of the change`
  where `XXXXX` is the number at the start of the branch name (up to the first `_` or other separator).

**Algorithm:**

1. Find a previous commit message, it might already contain the [#XXXXX] pattern.
2. Determine the current branch name.
3. Extract the first sequence of digits (usually up to the `_` character), eg. `12345_branch_name`.
4. Use it in square brackets with a `#` at the start of the commit message (no spaces inside the brackets).
5. After the brackets, provide a concise, to-the-point description of the change.

**Correct examples:**

Branch name: `12345_branch_name`
Commit message: `[#12345] Add new documentation section`

Branch name: `67890_branch_name`
Commit message: `[#67890] Fix data processing bug`

**Incorrect examples:**
- `Add new documentation section` — no issue number
- `[12345] Fix bug` — no # symbol
- `[ #12345 ] Fix bug in module X, add tests, update docs` — spaces inside brackets

**Requirements:**

- The message must be concise, structured, and strictly relevant to the changes in the commit avoid blabber.
- Keep the length to the minimum necessary.

### 2. Regulation Process Template (HTML)

I could not find a file named `Регламент_процесса_шаблон.htm` or any similar HTML file in the expected directories. The only files related to hiring and process regulation in the `taxonomies` directory are BPMN, JSON, MD, and JPEG files. There are also no `.htm` or `.html` files with a similar name in the workspace based on the search results.

#### Next Steps / Questions:
- If you want a detailed breakdown or visualization of the BPMN process, let me know.
- If you have the regulation template file in another location or under a different name, please provide the correct path or filename, and I can analyze it as well.

Would you like a more detailed step-by-step description of the BPMN process, or do you want to clarify the location of the regulation template file?

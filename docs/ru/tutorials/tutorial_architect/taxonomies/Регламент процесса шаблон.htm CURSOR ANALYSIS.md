### 2. Regulation Process Template (HTML)

I could not find a file named `Регламент процесса шаблон.htm` or any similar HTML file in the expected directories. The only files related to hiring and process regulation in the `taxonomies` directory are BPMN, JSON, MD, and JPEG files. There are also no `.htm` or `.html` files with a similar name in the workspace based on the search results.

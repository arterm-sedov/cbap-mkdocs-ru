# Script operation error

When setting up a button with the C# script operation, it is always important to do everything correctly. Incorrectly written logic, system names for templates, attributes, etc. may result in the script failure. What should you pay attention to when finding the causes for the script operation error in case it occurs?

**Solution:**

1. CheckÂ the correctness of the script.
2. Check roles permissions. It is important that the role has permissions to the button itself and to all the templates specified in the script.

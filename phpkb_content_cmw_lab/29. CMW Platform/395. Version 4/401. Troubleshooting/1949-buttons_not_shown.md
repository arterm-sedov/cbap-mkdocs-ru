# Buttons are not displayed

As part of creating a solution, buttons are often configured with the help of which users can perform certain operations (save a record, export a record to a customized template, initiate a process, etc.). Buttons can be located both in the upper panel of tables and forms, and on the forms themselves.

What if you customize and place the buttons, but the users can't see them?

**Solution**

1. Check the user role permissions settings. The «Use buttons» flag next to the button must be checked.
2. Check the button’s display condition. To do this, go to the button’s settings, then to the «Display condition» tab. Make sure that the expression, if it is written there, is correct.

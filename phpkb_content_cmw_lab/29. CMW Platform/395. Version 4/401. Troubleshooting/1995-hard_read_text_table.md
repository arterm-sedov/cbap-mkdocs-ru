# Unreadable text fields in a table on the form

By default, a limited amount of text is displayed in the table cells. To view all the text in a cell, the user can hover the mouse pointer over it — the text will be displayed in a tooltip. However, if the text is very large, it can be inconvenient to read it this way. In this case, the user should be able to view the entire record in a separate form.

**Solution**

1. In the form settings, add the «***Navigate***» button to the table toolbar.
2. Click on the added button, and in the right menu select the form which will open up for each record from the table.
3. Save the form.
4. Open any record, right-click on the cell with the text and select «***Navigate***».

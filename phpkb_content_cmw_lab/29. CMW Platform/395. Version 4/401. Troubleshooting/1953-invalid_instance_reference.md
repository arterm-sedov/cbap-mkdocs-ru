# Invalid instance hyperlink

If a user receives a system notification about a task assigned to him/her, and when he/she clicks on a link to a task, the system either gives an error or leads him/her to the wrong place, then most likely the system notifications were configured incorrectly.

Pay special attention to which external server address is specified in the global configuration. It must match the current URL.

<h1>Unreadable text fields in a table on the form</h1><p>By default, a limited amount of text is displayed in the table cells. To view all the text in a cell, the user can hover the mouse pointer over it — the text will be displayed in a tooltip. However, if the text is very large, it can be inconvenient to read it this way. In this case, the user should be able to view the entire record in a separate form.</p>

<h1>Can&amp;#039;t start a process based on several records</h1><p>In <strong>CMW Platform</strong> you can configure a button to start a process by a record. However, the possibility to select multiple records on the list can be somewhat confusing. It is impossible to start a process based on several records, since conflicts in attributes, actions, rules, etc. will arise.</p>
<p>Thus, one process = one record.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>If you still want to provide users with the ability to select several records to start the process, then you will need to create a button with the script operation that will start a process for each record, or start a related process using several records.</p>

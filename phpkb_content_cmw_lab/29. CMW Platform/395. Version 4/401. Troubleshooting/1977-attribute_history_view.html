<h1>Calculated attribute change log cannot be viewed</h1><p>In the settings of the attribute there is a «<em><strong>Track changes</strong></em>» flag, after applying which any changes in the attribute will be recorded. This flag can be set only for non-calculated attributes. History cannot be saved for calculated attributes, since calculated attributes are subject of computation and their value is always unstable.</p>
<p>All changes to the attribute values ​​are saved in the system change log. To view the change log, open a record, click on the «Information» button on the ribbon of the form and select «<em><strong>Change log</strong></em>».</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>If you still need to store change log of calculated attributes, then:</p>
<ol class="colored_numbers_list">
<li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2px;">Create a non-calculated attribute (for each calculated one).</span></li>
<li>Manually (or by scenario) write the calculated value in the new attribute.</li>
</ol>

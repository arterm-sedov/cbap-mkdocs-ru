<h1>Table stopped working (error «Object reference not set to an instance of an object»)</h1><p>If a table that used to work stopped working for a user or several users: the table does not open and the error message «Object reference not set to an instance of an object» is displayed, then most likely there is a conflict between the personal configuration of the table and the system configuration of the table. Perhaps some changes were made to the system settings of the table, for example, an attribute was removed that was filtered in the personal configuration of the table.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>This problem can only be fixed by deleting the personal configuration of the table where the error occurred. The appearance of the table for the end user will thus be returned to the default settings.</p>

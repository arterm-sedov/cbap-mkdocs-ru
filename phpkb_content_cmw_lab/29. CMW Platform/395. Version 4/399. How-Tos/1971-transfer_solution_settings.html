<h1>Transferring business solutions</h1><p>When building a business solution, it is a good practice to create several instances for different purposes: development instance, test instance, production instance; and then transferring solution settings between instances. Business solution settings can be transferred in 4 ways:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Transferring a database.</p>
<p>In this case, all the settings of the instance, as well as all the data, will be transferred.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Pulling business application configuration from Git.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Transferring all the settings manually.</p>
<p>Manual transfer implies a step-by-step transfer of data and settings between instances manually, that is, a new business application is configured from scratch. It is recommended to use this method with a small amount of data.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Export / import of a business application configuration (see the article <samp data-name="aid" data-title="" data-value="1973"><span style="color: #0066bc; font-family: Tahoma;"><img src="https://kb.cmwlab.com/images/marker.png" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>{Article-ID:1973}</span></samp>).</p>
<p>This method is limited to transferring records in business application templates, all the settings and data will be transferred, with the exception of template records. This method is characterized by a fast speed of data transfer.</p>

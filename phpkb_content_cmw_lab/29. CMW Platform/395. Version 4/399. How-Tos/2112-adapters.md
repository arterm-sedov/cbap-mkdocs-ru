# Adapters

# Definitions

An adapter is a module (compiled as a DLL) that provides custom connection and communication route to integrate the **Platform** with external systems

Use the **Adapters** section to load and compile custom modules to connect the **{{ productName }}** to external systems.

Loaded modules are compiled on the server side, and corresponding connections become available when creating connections and communication routes.

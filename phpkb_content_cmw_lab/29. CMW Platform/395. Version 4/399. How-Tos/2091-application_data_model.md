# Understanding the Application Data Model

## Record Template Definition

The application data model in the **CMW Platform** is built upon the **record templates**. You can think of a record template as a registry, table, entity, or class.

The record template is defined by its **attributes** (similar to the class attributes or table fields). The attributes are used in the forms, tables, export templates, and other application elements.

The analysts (developing the application) and end users view the data stored in the record template (the **records**) in forms or tables similar to Excel sheets.

The underlining database stores the data in a graph structure.

**Note:** account templates, organizational unit templates, and role templates are **record templates** with special system attributes and behavior.
## Data Model Diagrams

To visually build the application data model, use the **Data model diagrams**.

Use the data model diagram designer to view or configure the account and record templates along with their relationships and attributes.

You can save several versions of a data model diagram and recall them to have different data model visualizations.

## Class Diagrams

You can also draw **Class diagrams** that represent the application templates as classes.

Use the class diagram designer to view and configure the account, process, and record templates along with their associations, cardinality, attributes, and button operations.

You can save several versions of a class diagram and recall them to have different class visualizations.
